2010-02-19    v1.015
  - Hostnames like http://myapplication/ were not setting session cookies properly.
  - $Config->data_connections->session->cookie_domain should set to "*" in these cases.
  - $Response->SetCookie accepts the "*" value for domain also.
  - The result is that no "domain=xyz" attribute is given to these cookies.

2010-02-18    v1.014
  - $Response->ContentType now functions correctly.
  - Upgrade mandatory!

2010-02-18    v1.013
  - ASP4::HandlerResolver was not properly remembering timestamps on handler files.
    This resulted in unnecessary reloads of handlers that had not been changed.

2010-02-18    v1.012
  - MANIFEST was missing a few files that caused tests to fail.

2010-02-17    v1.011
  ! Upgrade Recommended !
  - $Response->SetCookie and $Response->ContentType were not functioning properly.
  - Added new method $Response->SetHeader.

2010-02-10    v1.010
  ! UPGRADE *SERIOUSLY* RECOMMENDED !
  - In an environment with multiple VirtualHosts running ASP4 web applications,
    ASP4::HandlerResolver's %HandlerCache and %FileTimes hashes were shared between
    all VirtualHosts.  This means that if you had 2 web apps (Foo and Bar) then
    "/index.asp" on "Foo" might get handled by "Bar::_index_asp" or vice versa.

2010-02-08    v1.009
  ! Upgrade Recommended !
  - ASP4::ModPerl sets $ENV{DOCUMENT_ROOT} = $r->document_root before doing 
    anything else.
  - The scaffold website output by 'asphelper' had some minor bugs:
      * email was sometimes referred to as email_address
      * The error message for the 'message' field was displaying the wrong error.

2010-02-07    v1.008
  - Multi-value form parameters (eg 3 checkboxes with the same name) will now
    *correctly* appear as an arrayref in $Form, instead of 3 values joined with
    a null byte.

2010-01-31    v1.007
  - $FileUpload->SaveAs("/path/to/file.txt") will now create "/path" and "/path/to"
    before writing "/path/to/file.txt".

2010-01-27    v1.006
  - Sometimes changes in MasterPages are not immediately reflected in child pages.
    This release attempts to correct this bug.

2010-01-25    v1.005
  - Request Filters were not always matching properly
    because of a regexp bug in ASP4::FilterResolver.

2010-01-22    v1.004
  - $ENV{REQUEST_URI} was not getting set properly - this is now fixed.

2009-12-22    v1.003
  - $ENV{HTTP_REFERER} can be set and preserved properly.
  - conf/asp4-config.json will be reloaded if it is modified.  This means that
    the server does not have to be restarted for changes to asp4-config.json 
    to take effect.
  - Added ASP4::TransHandler

2009-12-17    v1.002
  - %ENV is no longer clobbered by ASP4::UserAgent.

2009-12-16    v1.001
  - Fixed a bug that prevented ASP4 for reliably detecting when an ASP script
    had been updated.

2009-12-15    v1.000
  - Ready for production use.

2009-12-14    v0.001_03 .. v0.001_05
  - Just getting the Makefile.PL prerequisites correct.

2009-12-13    v0.001_02
  - Added POD.

2009-12-13    v0.001_01
  * Initial release
